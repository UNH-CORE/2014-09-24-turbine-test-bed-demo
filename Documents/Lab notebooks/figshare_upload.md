Uploading raw data to figshare

1. Create a `README.md` file for the raw dataset with a link to the GitHub repo.
2. Add to a new fileset, and make it public (if you want to be able to read the raw data URLs after uploading).
3. Get the article number from the URL of the fileset, e.g. 1554891 for this dataset.
4. Put the URL in `Scripts/upload.py`.
5. Run `Scripts/upload.py`.
